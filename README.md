# hello-world
This is a tutorial repository
This is a bit about myself. The tutorial told me to write something about myself in the readme file.
So that's what I did. Here is that thing about myself. It might tell you that I'm overly literal, or have a shitty
sense of humor. Most of all it tells you that I have an odd sense of creativity, which may or may not be lacking
overall in the first place. But enough of that, I think this message is long enough now so lets levae it at that.
